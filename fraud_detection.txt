Running use case: Fraud detection
ML Use Case Design


Problem Framing


	qualitative
	quantitative
	question
	Current State
	Fraud create loss to the bank
	5% fraud => bank cann’t tolerate
	what is the current situation (pains/desires) that we want to address and why?
	Objectives
	* Build a model that can detect fraud


* Less fraud => less loss to the bank
	Fraud >= 5% bank may loose a huge revenue
	what is that we want to do and why? (to improve topline/bottomline?)
	Benefit/ Cost Tradeoff and Prioratization
	* Cost of error:
If we decrease the fraud tolerance much we may loose potential customer 


	cost-benefit matrix




c(TP)
	c(FP)
	c(FN)
	c(TN)
	



1% TP => 0.5% less fraud => 10% less loss for bank


1% FP => 1% more risk of loosing customer => 1% loss for the bank


1% FN => 0.1% more fraud => 2% more loss for the bank 


1% TN => no significant impact on revenue
	what are the cost of errors/benefits of correct predictions and why?
	Constraints
	can only afford a small FP percent => we may loose the customer => less profit to the bank




	At most 5% FP=> 5% revenue loss for 10% less fraud 
	what are the acceptable risks/budgets and why?
	Desired State
	* benefit: significantly lesser fraaud=> significantly less money loss => significantly better revenue
* cost: very few false positives => limited risk of losing cutomer => limited risk to revenue
	* at least 50% decrease in Fraud=> 10% less loss of money => 5% more revenue
* at most 10% false positives => 1% loss of customer =>0.1% risk to revenue
	what is the desired outcome (benefits/costs) that we want to see and why?
	





Why ML


	qualitative
	quantitative
	question
	best non-ML alternative
hypothesis
	classify based on a income of person => too many FP and FN => more customer loss as well fraud
	50% FP 70% FN => loose 10% of customer and 10% more fraud 
	what are the non-ML alternatives and why are they problematic? (pains/missed gains)?
	ML value proposition hypothesis
	much fewer FP and FN => less customer loss and less fraud => much better revenue
	10% FP 50% FN => 50% less fraud in expense of 10% less customer => 5% increase in revenue at the expense of 0.1% risk
	what are the advantages (pain relievers/gain creators) of ML solution and why?
	ML feasibility
hypothesis
	* data: labeled dataset of each person bank history with their fraud history
* model: state of the art review suggests promising candidates are available
	* data: around five thousand samples
* model: state of the art claim solutions with 10% FP 20% FN
	what data and model are good candidates and why?
